# MIDAS-static-website
This is sample static multipage website for MIDAS IIITD which I have  created. 
It has a login/sign-up page which is static in nature. I have created this website using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap. This site is publicly deployed on GitHub and the link is given below:

The above website link which I have given is of a static website with a static login system. I have also created the same website with a dynamic working login system. The github link can be found for it below.

One can go to this link clone all the files there into their computer and run 'npm install' in the terminal  to download the required node modules. Then one can type 'npm start' to start the local server at port 3000. After that in any browser one can run the localhost server and the website will be launched. Here I made a working login system but without any database. So, once the server is started again, the previous data will not be there so the user needs to register again.
The YouTube video link for the working of the web-app is given below:
